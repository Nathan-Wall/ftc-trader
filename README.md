# FTC Trader

This program functions as an extremely basic Feathercoin trader.  It's functionality is really bare, and it's really only intended as an example Proto program, not a useful trader.

Look through the files to see how to:

1. Set up a basic Proto program
2. Utilize `async` and `await` in Proto to handle asynchronous control flow
3. Convert Node.js extensions to be used in Proto
